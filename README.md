## Overview
An open source project powered by Docker for managing applications, game servers and more. Ditch Pterodactyl or PufferPanel and fly higher with a panel that isn't named after a creature.

> [!WARNING]
> Skyport is not ready for production use, nor does it have a stable and completed release yet.
